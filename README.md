# Maze-Solving-Algorithm
Allows you to draw a maze, then shows it being automatically solved using a heuristic function that can be modified by the user.

There are 2 programs; one that can create and solve a map with just a floor and impassable walls, and one that can also create and solve one with terraign heights from 1 to 10.

I have kept them separate because the methods of solving the one without terrain heights can be far more efficient, however they don't work when terrain heights are introduced.
The rtf files provide an explanation for each.
